# lisp-rs

Quick & dirty implementation of a Lisp in Rust because why not. Very similar to
its cousin [lisg](https://github.com/crockeo/lisg), except that it doesn't have
the same lofty dreams of compiling to Rust.

## Usage

```bash
# insert your favorite git clone command
$ cd lisp-rs
$ cargo run
> (+ 1 2)
3
```
